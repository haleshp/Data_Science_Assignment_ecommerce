Data Science Assignment: eCommerce Transactions Dataset
Overview
This assignment involves performing data analysis and developing machine learning models using an eCommerce Transactions dataset. The dataset consists of three files: Customers.csv, Products.csv, and Transactions.csv. Your task is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), build a lookalike model, and apply customer segmentation (clustering) techniques.
Files Overview
The dataset includes the following CSV files:
•	Customers.csv: Contains customer details.
•	Products.csv: Contains product information.
•	Transactions.csv: Contains transaction history.
File Descriptions
1. Customers.csv
•	CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer.
•	CustomerName: Name of the customer.
•	Region: Continent where the customer resides.
•	SignupDate: Date when the customer signed up.
2. Products.csv
•	ProductID: Unique identifier for each product.
•	ProductName: Name of the product.
•	Category: Product category.
•	Price: Product price in USD.
3. Transactions.csv
•	TransactionID: Unique identifier for each transaction.
•	CustomerID: ID of the customer who made the transaction.
•	ProductID: ID of the product sold.
•	TransactionDate: Date of the transaction.
•	Quantity: Quantity of the product purchased.
•	TotalValue: Total value of the transaction.
•	Price: Price of the product sold.
Assignment Tasks
Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Business Insights
1.	Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the provided dataset.
2.	Derive at least 5 business insights from the EDA.
o	Write these insights in short point-wise sentences (maximum 100 words per insight).
Deliverables:
•	Jupyter Notebook/Python Script: Contains your EDA code.
•	PDF Report: Includes business insights (maximum 500 words).

Task 2: Lookalike Model
1.	Build a Lookalike Model that recommends 3 similar customers based on their profile and transaction history.
o	The model should use both customer and product information.
o	Assign a similarity score to each recommended customer.
Deliverables:
•	Lookalike.csv: Map customer IDs to their top 3 lookalikes with similarity scores.
•	Jupyter Notebook/Python Script: Explains your model development.
Evaluation Criteria:
•	Model accuracy and logic.
•	Quality of recommendations and similarity scores.

Task 3: Customer Segmentation / Clustering
1.	Perform customer segmentation using clustering techniques.
o	Use both profile information (from Customers.csv) and transaction data (from Transactions.csv).
o	Choose any clustering algorithm and any number of clusters between 2 and 10.
o	Calculate clustering metrics, including the DB Index.
o	Visualize your clusters using relevant plots.
Deliverables:
•	Clustering Report: Includes the number of clusters formed, DB Index value, and other relevant clustering metrics.
•	Jupyter Notebook/Python Script: Contains your clustering code.
Evaluation Criteria:
•	Clustering logic and metrics.
•	Visual representation of clusters.
